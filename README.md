### Overview

Aqua Page Builder is a powerful WordPress plugin that allows you to create an unlimited number of template variations for use in your WordPress themes. 
It follows the same user interface used by the Menus & Widgets admin pages - making you feel right at home with the UI.

Similar to the Widgets &amps Menus, Aqua Page Builder features the drag and drop interaction to build its templates.

### User Guide

**Basic Instructions**  
* Download the package, unzip.
* Rename the folder to "aqua-page-builder"

I've written a quite extensive guide for the users so they can get up and running
with the plugin in no time. The link to this guide is provided in the "Help" tab
